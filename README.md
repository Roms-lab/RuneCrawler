## AntiCheat

AntiCheat Implemented ⚠️ (In Progress)

### DISCLAMER
No you cannot just delete anticheat.ixx and remove the module sence the anticheat holds needed game data to prevent removing.

### Cheating Consequences

If the AntiCheat detects that you modified the game in unpremitted way Ex. Changing Coins to 100000, the program will close, revert changes, or clear user save data.

Do not cheat. Even though this game is open source cheating will not be tolerated.

### Modding

I do condone modding.

If you would like to mod the game go ahead, make the game better! This project is open souce and I do allow modding.
